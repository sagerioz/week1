            <h2>Seasons Change</h2>
            <p>With the days getting shorter, now is the perfect time to build a backyard treehouse for your kids — or for yourself. Treehouses are no longer just play spaces for children; they’re also places for adults to unwind, pursue their hobbies and
                even make their primary residence. Today, about 15 companies are in the “treehouse business,” with specialized teams of engineers and interior designers building custom-designed backyard escapes and providing kits and tools for homeowners
                looking to construct their own. Here’s a look at the growing trend.

            <h3>Function</h3>

            <p>
                Fall City, Wash.-based <a href="http://www.nelsontreehouseandsupply.com/" target="_blank">Nelson Treehouse and Supply</a>, featured on Animal Planet’s “Treehouse Masters,” has built everything from breweries and recording studios to spas
                with steam showers — all suspended in trees. “A lot of people think of treehouses and children, but nine out of 10 treehouses we build are for adults,” said Daryl McDonald, the team’s foreman. “People want an escape pod — a way to get
                out of the busyness of being in a home.” Tory Jones, the TV show’s interior designer, says the sky is the limit when it comes to designing a treehouse. But first you must think about what you need that extra space to be and how you want
                it to function. “Design follows function,” she said. “I’ve literally done everything from mid-century modern to contemporary and mission craftsman style.”

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="http://o2treehouse.com" target="_blank"> 02 Treehouse</a>, a California-based company that will be appearing in an upcoming episode of "<a href="http://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/treehouse-masters/" target="_blank">Treehouse Masters</a>,” is experimenting with not only function but design. “I’ve gotten into
                more complex forms in the geodesic family,” said Justin Feider, the company’s owner and lead builder. “One of my favorites is the honeysphere with 200 openings.” Feider says the geodesic shape makes sense for a treehouse because of its
                strength. The design is also a reflection of architecture and nature, he says. “People’s consciousness of the green movement and their inherent responsibility in that story has been on the rise,” Feider explained. “Treehouses are part
                of that. They’re the poster child for living sustainably in a natural structure — a symbiotic relationship with a tree.”

            <h3>Construction</h3>
            <p>
                Both Nelson and O2 provide treehouse consultations, construction and installation in the U.S. and abroad. The process typically takes between two days and nine months, depending on the size and complexity of the project.</p>
